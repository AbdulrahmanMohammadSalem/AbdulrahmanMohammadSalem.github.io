# Description
The **Dates.h** library is a self-contained, namespace-based C++ header designed to simplify date and time operations. It provides developers with a rich toolkit for date validation, formatting, arithmetic, comparisons, and calendar generation. Unlike typical system-limited functions, this library introduces fine-grained control over temporal data, making it a powerful utility for both academic projects and production-level applications.

The project builds on foundational exercises but extends them with robust enhancements, ensuring accuracy and flexibility when handling real-world date and time scenarios.

It also integrates seamlessly with the [`Strings.h`](/CppLibs/Strings/) and [`Readers.h`](/CppLibs/Readers/) utilities, showcasing modular design across multiple libraries.

# Technologies Used
- **C++** (Core language, STL containers & algorithms)
- **Namespaces** (`dates`, `dates_utilities`) for modular structure
- **Custom Utility Libraries**
  - `Strings.h`
  - `Readers.h`
- `C Standard Libraries` (`ctime`, `sstream`, `iomanip`, `vector`)

# Functionality & Features
## Validation
  - Check leap years, valid days in a month/year.
  - Validate dates against custom or preset formats (DMY, MDY, YMD).
  -Catch inconsistencies (e.g., `yy` vs `yyyy` mismatches in date formats).

## Formatting
  - Format dates numerically or with full/abbreviated month names.
  - Support suffixes like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.
  - Flexible custom patterns (`dd-mm-yyyy`, `mm/dd/yy`, etc.).
  - Time formatting with 12-hour or 24-hour clocks, with optional seconds.

## Arithmetic
  - Add or subtract days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, millennia.
  - Compute differences between two dates, with optional inclusion of end days.
  - Calculate ages and durations.

## Calendars
  - Generate text-based month and year calendars.
  - Query weekdays, weekends, and business days.

## System Integration
  - Retrieve system date, time, and combined datetime.
  - Detect current weekday position and name.

## Advanced Utilities
  - Vacation/business day calculators (skipping weekends).
  - Period overlap detection and overlap day counting.
  - Reading and validating user-entered date strings with error messages.

# Implementation Highlights
- **Robust Enumeration System** – Clean enums define weekdays, formats, month name styles, AM/PM indicators, and validation error types, ensuring readability and maintainability.
- **Two-Level Validation Approach** – Supports both preset (DMY, MDY, YMD) and custom formats, with deep validation of numeric/text consistency.
- **Optimized Date Arithmetic** – Distinguishes between few vs many days/weeks additions for performance.
- **Leap Year Safety** – Prevents invalid carry-overs (e.g., February 29th adjustments across leap years).
- **Calendar Printing** – Produces aligned, text-based calendars without third-party dependencies.
- **Integration with `Strings.h` and `Readers.h`** – Uses string utilities for parsing and reader utilities for interactive input, creating a seamless ecosystem of reusable libraries.

# Conclusion
- Provides a **comprehensive and reusable date/time toolkit** for C++.
- Demonstrates strong understanding of **validation**, **arithmetic**, **and data modeling**.
- Implements **thoughtful safeguards** (leap years, format mismatches, edge cases).
- Balances **usability (calendar printing, business day counting)** with **low-level precision (date comparisons, day offsets)**.
- Serves as a strong showcase of **modular design** and **clean namespace-based architecture**.
