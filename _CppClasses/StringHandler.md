# Description
The **StringHandler** class is an **object-oriented** wrapper around the [`Strings.h`](/CppLibs/Strings/) library, designed to make string manipulation in C++ more intuitive and maintainable. By encapsulating string operations into a dedicated class, it provides both **static methods** (for utility-style usage) and **instance methods** (for object-based manipulation).

This dual design makes the class suitable for **quick one-off transformations** as well as **stateful workflows** where a string undergoes multiple transformations through method chaining.

# Technologies Used
- **C++** (OOP concepts: encapsulation, properties, method overloading)
- **Custom Utility Library:** `Strings.h`
- **STL Components:** `string`, `vector`
- **Static vs. Instance Methods** for flexible usage patterns

# Functionality & Features
## Case Manipulation
- Convert to uppercase/lowercase (entire string or by tokens).
- Capitalize or lowercase first letters of words.
- Invert case and reverse strings/sequences.

## Validation & Checks
- Test for vowels, letters, punctuation, special characters, operators, and brackets.
- Detect string palindromes.

## Counting Operations
- Count vowels, uppercase, lowercase, letters, digits, spaces, or specific characters.
- Count tokens with single-character or string delimiters.

## Tokenization & Merging
- Extract tokens into vectors.
- Merge vectors/arrays back into delimited strings.

## Trimming & Cleaning
- Trim left/right/both sides.
- Remove or keep only digits, letters, specials, punctuation, operations, or brackets.
- Remove/keep a specific character.

## Replacement Operations
- Replace substrings globally, by count, or by tokens.
- Case-sensitive or case-insensitive replacements.

## Advanced Utilities
- Convert numbers to text.
- Provide both static methods for quick use and instance methods for modifying the object's internal `_value`.

# Implementation Highlights
- **Property-Like Access** (`Value` with getter/setter) mimics higher-level language behavior while keeping C++ idiomatic.
- **Dual Approach:** Every method is available in both `static` (utility-style) and `non-static` (object state mutation) forms.
- **Wrapper Architecture:** Cleanly encapsulates the procedural `Strings.h` functions into a class, demonstrating OOP skills.
- **Consistency:** Method names are intuitive and consistently mirror their underlying Strings.h `counterparts`.
- **Extendability:** The design allows seamless integration of future string utilities without breaking existing workflows.

# Conclusion
- Provides a **clean OOP abstraction** over procedural string utilities.
- Demonstrates mastery of **encapsulation**, **static vs. instance method design, and class-based organization**.
- Balances **flexibility** (utility methods) with **state management** (object methods).
- Bridges the gap between **low-level string utilities** and **high-level, developer-friendly APIs**.
- Serves as a strong example of applying **object-oriented design principles** in C++.

# How to Use
1. Download the header file from the section below.
2. Include it in your C++ project using `#include "..."`, with the appropriate path between the double quotes.
3. Make sure that you have `Strings.h` also installed.
