# Description
The **DateHandler** class is a C++ library that encapsulates date-related functionality in a clean, object-oriented interface. Built directly on top of the lower-level [**`Dates.h`**](/CppLibs/Dates/) library, it focuses exclusively on handling **dates** (not time or period calculations), making it easier for developers to work with calendars, date validation, and formatting.

By abstracting away raw function calls from `Dates.h`, this class provides a more natural workflow for developers who prefer object-oriented design, while still retaining the reliability and versatility of the underlying namespace-based implementation.

# Technologies Used
- **C++ (OOP)**
- **Custom Utility Library:** `Dates.h`

# Functionality & Features
## Date Construction
  - Initialize from system date, string input, day/month/year, or day-order-in-year.

## Validation & Formatting
  - Validate dates and formats.
  - Format dates into customizable string patterns.

## Calendar Operations
  - Retrieve month and year calendars.
  - Identify day names, month names, and week positions.

## Date Navigation
  - Move forward or backward by days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, or millennia.

## Comparisons & Queries
  - Check if a date is before/after/equal to another date.
  - Verify if a date is valid, end-of-week, weekend, or business day.
  - Calculate total days until end of week, month, or year.

## Special Utilities
  - Calculate age from birth date.
  - Estimate vacation or business days between ranges.
  - Read dates interactively in specific formats.

# Implementation Highlights
  - **Wrapper Design:** The class serves as an OOP wrapper over `Dates.h`, giving a user-friendly object model while preserving the full power of the namespace functions.
  - **Smart Constructors:** Multiple constructors handle different initialization scenarios, from system defaults to string-based parsing with validation.
  - **Property Syntax:** Uses `__declspec(property)` to expose `Day`, `Month`, `Year`, and `Format` with getter/setter semantics, emulating higher-level language convenience in C++.
  - **Seamless Integration:** Naturally leverages `Strings.h` for formatting and `Readers.h` for input, showing strong modular design.
  - **Comprehensive Coverage:** Implements virtually every date manipulation imaginableâ€”from checking leap years to calculating differences across millennia.

## Conclusion
  - Provides a **developer-friendly OOP abstraction** over a function-heavy date library.
  - Strengthens **code readability and maintainability* by wrapping raw functions into class methods.
  - Demonstrates advanced C++ **features** like property declarations and multiple constructor overloads.
  - Serves as a foundation for **real-world calendar, scheduling, and business applications**.
  - Highlights a **modular ecosystem approach**, tying together multiple custom libraries.

## How to Use
1. Download the header file from the section below.
2. Include it in your C++ project using `#include "..."`, with the appropriate path between the double quotes.
3. Make sure that you have [`Dates.h`](/CppLibs/Dates/) also installed.
